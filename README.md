Trading bots with Python

# tradingBotArchitecture:
Algorithmic traders may be interested in developing more sophisticated trading bots that incorporate functions such as multiple data analyses, news sentiment analysis, and artificial intelligence.
In order to manage the increased complexity of the bot, it is crucial to have a clean, well-structured software architecture.

The purpose of this repo is to propose a generic architecture for trading bots that can be applied to any type of market. An object-oriented, typed data model is implemented in Python as part of the architecture.

Among the components/classes of the model are:

- Data Loader
- Bot
- Logging System
- Order
- Trade
- Position
- Broker
